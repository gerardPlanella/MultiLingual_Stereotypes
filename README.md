## STEREOTYPES IN MULTILINGUAL LANGUAGE MODELS
This repository contains all the code used for the realisation of the ATCS Project : Stereotypes In MultiLingual Language Models.  this project, we study stereotypes that emergewithin pre-trained Multilingual Language Models(MLMs). These models are typically trained on large-scale multilingual text corpora, learning torepresent the different languages in a shared em-bedding space. This shared representation allows the model to generalize knowledge learned in one language to other languages, a phenomenon known as cross-lingual transfer (Conneau et al., 2019). Our objective is to build upon the work of Choenni et al., 2021 by initially contrasting emotion profilesof identical social groups across diverse languages within these MLMs.
